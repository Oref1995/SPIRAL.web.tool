# SPIRAL
SPIRAL is an algorithm that relies on a Gaussian statistical model to produce a comprehensive overview of significant
processes in single cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics or bulk RNA-seq. SPIRAL detects biological processes by
identifying the subset of genes involved and the subset of cells, spots or samples.

SPIRAL is available as a web interface at https://spiral.technion.ac.il/ (currently only available in the Technion).
You can also run SPIRAL locally by downloading the repository, and then run SPIRAL_local_run.py.
